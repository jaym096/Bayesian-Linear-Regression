# Bayesian-Linear-Regression

This is an academic project done in the course **CSCI-B55 Machine Learning** at Indiana University.

Applied **Regularized Bayesian Linear Rgression** on various datasets and experimented with the regularization parameter to find the best
statistical model. Leveraged Bayesian model selection to find the parameters of the prior. Compared different approaches and concluded
that Bayesian model selection is a good method to obtain hyperparameters for statistical model.
